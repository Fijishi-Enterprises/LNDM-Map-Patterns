## Overview

**landscapemetrics** is an R package for calculating landscape metrics
for categorical landscape patterns in a tidy workflow. The package can be
used as a drop-in replacement for FRAGSTATS (McGarigal *et al.* 2012), as it
offers a reproducible workflow for landscape analysis in a single environment.
It also allows for calculations of four theoretical metrics of landscape
complexity: an overall spatio-thematic complexity, a thematic complexity, a configurational complexity, and a disambiguator of pattern types having the
same overall complexity (Nowosad and Stepinski 2018).

**landscapemetrics** supports `raster` spatial objects and takes `RasterLayer`,
`RasterStacks`, `RasterBricks` or lists of `RasterLayer` as input
arguments. Every function can be used in a piped workflow, as it always
takes the data as the first argument and returns a tibble. 

## Installation

There are several ways to install `landscapemetrics`:

```r
# The easiest way is to install landscapemetrics from CRAN
install.packages("landscapemetrics")

# Alternatively, you can install the stable development version from Github
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("r-spatialecology/landscapemetrics", ref = "stable")
```

## Using landscapemetrics

The resolution of a raster cell has to be in **meters**, as the package converts units internally and returns
results in either meters, square meters or hectares. Before using landscapemetrics, be sure to check your projection.

All functions in **landscapemetrics** start with `lsm_` (for landscapemetrics). 
The second part of the name specifies the level (patch - `p`, class - `c` or landscape - `l`).
The last part of the function name is the abbreviation of the corresponding metric 
(e.g. `enn`for the euclidean nearest-neighbor distance):   

```
# general structure
lsm_"level"_"metric"

# Patch level
## lsm_p_"metric"
lsm_p_enn()

# Class level
## lsm_c_"metric"
lsm_c_enn()

# Landscape level
## lsm_p_"metric"
lsm_l_enn()
```

All functions return an identical structured tibble:

<center>
<p style="text-align:center;">

| layer | level     | class | id | metric           | value |
| ----- | --------- | ----- | -- | ---------------- | ----- |
| 1     | patch     | 1     | 1  | landscape metric | x     |
| 1     | class     | 1     | NA | landscape metric | x     |
| 1     | landscape | NA    | NA | landscape metric | x     |

</p>
</center>

### Using metric functions

Every function follows the same implementation design, so the usage is
quite straightforward:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(landscapemetrics)
library(dplyr)

# Landscape raster
landscape

# Calculate for example the Euclidean nearest-neighbor distance on patch level
lsm_p_enn(landscape)

# Calculate the total area and total class edge length
bind_rows(
    lsm_l_ta(landscape), 
    lsm_c_te(landscape)
)
```

There is also a wrapper around every metric in the package to quickly calculate
a bunch of metrics:

```{r, message=FALSE}
# calculate all metrics on patch level
calculate_lsm(landscape, what = "patch")
```

### Utility functions

**landscapemetrics** further provides functions to visualize landscapes
as labeled patches and functions to select and analyse metrics you
calculated with the package.

Important building blocks of the package are exported to help facilitate analysis
or the development of new metrics. They all start with the prefix `get_`.
All of them are implemented with Rcpp and have either memory or performance advantages
compared to raster functions.

For more details, see the [utility function vignette](https://r-spatialecology.github.io/landscapemetrics/articles/articles/utility.html).

## Contributing

One of the major motivations behind **landscapemetrics** is the idea to
provide an open-source code collection of landscape metrics. This
includes, besides bug reports, especially the idea to include new
metrics. Therefore, in case you want to suggest new metrics and in the
best case even contribute code, we warmly welcome to do so\! For more
information see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).
