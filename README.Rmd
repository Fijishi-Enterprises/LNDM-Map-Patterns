## Overview

**landscapemetrics** is an R package for calculating landscape metrics for categorical landscape patterns in a tidy workflow. This package supports `raster` spatial objects and takes `RasterLayer`, `RasterStacks`, `RasterBricks` or lists of `RasterLayer` as input arguments. Every function can be used in a piped workflow, as it always takes the data as the first argument and returns a tibble of the same dimension.

There are already software packages available to calculate landscape metrics, the most famous one probably being the stand-alone software FRAGSTATS (McGarigal *et al.* 2012). But also add-ons to GIS software, e.g. r.le (Baker & Cai 1992) for GRASS GIS. Lastly, also a R package, namely SDMTools (VanDerWal *et al.* 2014), can be used.

Nevertheless, we decided to reimplement most of the metrics available in [FRAGSTATS](https://www.umass.edu/landeco/research/fragstats/documents/fragstats_documents.html). We wanted to provide a comprehensive collection of landscape metrics in R. While FRAGSTATS is a extensive collection it is only available for Windows. Note, that even though we tried to reimplement the metrics as described in the FRAGSTATS manual, there are some differences ([Differences FRAGSTATS|landscapemetrics](https://marcosci.github.io/landscapemetrics/articles/articles/comparing_fragstats_landscapemetrics.html)). Further, SDMTools as R package does only contain a subset of metrics does not cover all levels ([General background](https://marcosci.github.io/landscapemetrics/articles/articles/general-background.html)). Lastly, we want to start a collection of landscape metrics being open source and easily extendable by new (future) landscape metrics (see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md)).

Those were the main reasons we implemented **landscapemetrics**, however, we want to fully appreciate and acknowledge the already present software.

## Installation

You can install **landscapemetrics** from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("marcosci/landscapemetrics")
```

## Using landscapemetrics

The functions in **landscapemetrics** starts with `lsm_` and next are named based on a combination of abbreviations describing the scale (patch - `p`, class - `c` or landscape - `l`) and metric they calculate:

```
# landscapemetrics
lsm_"level"_"metric" example:

# Patch level
## lsm_p_"metric" example:
lsm_p_enn()

# Class level
## lsm_c_"metric" example:
lsm_c_enn()

# Landscape level
## lsm_p_"metric" example:
lsm_l_enn()
```

...and returns a tibble with the same columns:

<p style="text-align:center;">

| layer  | level | class | id | metric | value
| ------------- | -------------  | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| 1 | patch  | 1 | 1 | landscape metric | x |
| 1 | class  | 1 | NA | landscape metric | x |
| 1 | landscape  | NA | NA | landscape metric | x |

</p>

### Using metric functions

Every function follows the same implementation design, so the usage is quite straight forward:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(landscapemetrics)
library(tidyverse)

# Landscape raster
landscape

# Calculate for example the Euclidean Nearest-Neighbor Distance on patch level
landscape %>% 
  lsm_p_enn()
```

##  Contributing 

One of the major motivations behind **landscapemetrics** is the idea to provide an open-source code collection of landscape metrics. This includes, besides bug reports, especially the idea to include new metrics. Therefore, in case you want to suggest new metrics and in the best case even contribute code, we warmly welcome to do so! For more information see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).
