\description{
Aggregation index (Aggregation metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{AI = \Bigg[\frac{g_{ii}}{max-g_{ii}} \Bigg](100) }

where \eqn{g_{ii}} is the number of like adjacencies based on the single-count method and
\eqn{max-g_{ii}} is the classwise maximum number of like adjacencies of class i.

AI is an 'Aggregation metric'. It equals the number of like adjacencies divided
by the theoretical maximum possible number of like adjacencies for that class.
The metric is based on he adjacency matrix and the the single-count method.

\subsection{Units}{Percent}
\subsection{Range}{0 <= AI <= 100}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Equals 0 for maximally disaggregated and 100
for maximally aggregated classes.}
