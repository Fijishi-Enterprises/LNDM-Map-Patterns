\usage{
lsm_c_area_cv(landscape, directions = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{landscape}{Raster* Layer, Stack, Brick, SpatRaster (terra), stars, or a list of rasterLayers}

\item{directions}{The number of directions in which patches should be connected: 4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case).}
}
\value{
tibble
}
\description{
Coefficient of variation of patch area (Area and edge metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{AREA_{CV} = cv(AREA[patch_{ij}])}
where \eqn{AREA[patch_{ij}]} is the area of each patch in hectares.

AREA_CV is an 'Area and Edge metric'. The metric summarises each class
as the Coefficient of variation of all patch areas belonging to class i.
The metric describes the differences among patches of the same class i in
the landscape and is easily comparable because it is scaled to the mean.

\subsection{Units}{Hectares}
\subsection{Range}{AREA_CV >= 0}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Equals AREA_CV = 0 if all patches are identical in size.
Increases, without limit, as the variation of patch areas increases.}
