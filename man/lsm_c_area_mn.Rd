\item{directions}{The number of directions in which patches should be connected: 4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case).}

\description{
Mean of patch area (Area and edge metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{AREA_{MN} = mean(AREA[patch_{ij}])}
where \eqn{AREA[patch_{ij}]} is the area of each patch in hectares

AREA_MN is an 'Area and Edge metric'. The metric summarises each class
as the mean of all patch areas belonging to class i. The metric is a simple way
to describe the composition of the landscape. Especially together with the total
class area (\code{\link{lsm_c_ca}}), it can also give an an idea of patch structure
(e.g. many small patches vs. few larges patches).

\subsection{Units}{Hectares}
\subsection{Range}{AREA_MN > 0}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Approaches AREA_MN = 0 if all patches are small. Increases, without
limit, as the patch areas increase.}
