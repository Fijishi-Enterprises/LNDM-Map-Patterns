\description{
Landscape shape index (Aggregation metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{LSI = \frac{e_{i}} {\min e_{i}}}
where \eqn{e_{i}} is the total edge length in cell surfaces and \eqn{\min e_{i}}
is the minimum total edge length in cell surfaces.

LSI is an 'Aggregation metric'. It is the ratio between the actual edge length of
class i and the hypothetical minimum edge length of class i. The minimum edge length equals
the edge length if class i would be maximally aggregated.

\subsection{Units}{None}
\subsection{Ranges}{LSI >= 1}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Equals LSI = 1 when only one squared patch is present or all
patches are maximally aggregated. Increases, without limit, as the length of the
actual edges increases, i.e. the patches become less compact.}
