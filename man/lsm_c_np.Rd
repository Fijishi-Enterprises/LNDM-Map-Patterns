\usage{
lsm_c_np(landscape, directions = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{landscape}{Raster* Layer, Stack, Brick, SpatRaster (terra), stars, or a list of rasterLayers.}

\item{directions}{The number of directions in which patches should be
connected: 4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case).}
}
\value{
tibble

\description{
Number of patches (Aggregation metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{NP = n_{i}}
where \eqn{n_{i}} is the number of patches.

NP is an 'Aggregation metric'. It describes the fragmentation of a class, however, does not
necessarily contain information about the configuration or composition of the class.

\subsection{Units}{None}
\subsection{Ranges}{NP >= 1}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Equals NP = 1 when only one patch is present and
increases, without limit, as the number of patches increases}
