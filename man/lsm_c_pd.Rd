\description{
Patch density (class level)
}
\details{
Patch density equals the number of patches of class i divided by the total
area. Patch density is a relative measure and compareable among landscapes with
different total areas
\deqn{PD = number of patches / total area}
\subsection{Units}{Number per hectares (Number per 100 ha in FRAGSTATS???)}
\subsection{Ranges}{PD > 0}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Increases as the landscape gets more patchy}
