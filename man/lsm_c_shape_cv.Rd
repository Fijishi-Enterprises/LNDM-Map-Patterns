\description{
Covariance of variation shape index (Shape metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{SHAPE_{CV} = cv(SHAPE[patch_{ij}])}
where \eqn{SHAPE[patch_{ij}]} is the shape index of each patch.

SHAPE_CV is a 'Shape metric'. Each class is summarised as the coeffiecent of variation
of each patch belonging to class i. SHAPE describes the ratio between the actual perimeter
of the patch and the hypothetical minimum perimeter of the patch. The minimum perimeter
equals the perimeter if the patch would be maximally compact.

\subsection{Units}{None}
\subsection{Range}{SHAPE_CV >= 0}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Equals SHAPE_CV = 0 if all patches have an identical shape index.
Increases, without limit, as the variation of the shape index increases.}
