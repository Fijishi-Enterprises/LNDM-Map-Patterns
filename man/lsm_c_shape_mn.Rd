\usage{
lsm_c_shape_mn(landscape, directions = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{landscape}{Raster* Layer, Stack, Brick, SpatRaster (terra), stars, or a list of rasterLayers.}

\item{directions}{The number of directions in which patches should be
connected: 4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case).}
}
\value{
tibble

\description{
Mean shape index (Shape metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{SHAPE_{MN} = mean(SHAPE[patch_{ij}])}
where \eqn{SHAPE[patch_{ij}]} is the shape index of each patch.

SHAPE_MN is a 'Shape metric'. Each class is summarised as the mean
of each patch belonging to class i. SHAPE describes the ratio between the actual perimeter
of the patch and the hypothetical minimum perimeter of the patch. The minimum perimeter
equals the perimeter if the patch would be maximally compact.

\subsection{Units}{None}
\subsection{Range}{SHAPE_SD >= 1}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Equals SHAPE_MN = 0 if all patches are squares.
Increases, without limit, as the shapes of patches become more complex.}
