\usage{
lsm_c_shape_sd(landscape, directions = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{landscape}{Raster* Layer, Stack, Brick, SpatRaster (terra), stars, or a list of rasterLayers.}

\item{directions}{The number of directions in which patches should be
connected: 4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case).}
}
\value{
tibble
}
\description{
Standard deviation shape index (Shape metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{SHAPE_{SD} = sd(SHAPE[patch_{ij}])}
where \eqn{SHAPE[patch_{ij}]} is the shape index of each patch.

SHAPE_SD is a 'Shape metric'. Each class is summarised as the standard deviation
of each patch belonging to class i. SHAPE describes the ratio between the actual perimeter
of the patch and the hypothetical minimum perimeter of the patch. The minimum perimeter
equals the perimeter if the patch would be maximally compact.

\subsection{Units}{None}
\subsection{Range}{SHAPE_SD >= 0}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Equals SHAPE_SD = 0 if all patches have an identical shape index.
Increases, without limit, as the variation of the shape index increases.}
