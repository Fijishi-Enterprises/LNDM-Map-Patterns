\usage{
lsm_l_dcore_mn(
  landscape,
  directions = 8,
  consider_boundary = FALSE,
  edge_depth = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{landscape}{Raster* Layer, Stack, Brick, SpatRaster (terra), stars, or a list of rasterLayers.}

\item{directions}{The number of directions in which patches should be
connected: 4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case).}

\item{consider_boundary}{Logical if cells that only neighbour the landscape
boundary should be considered as core}

\item{edge_depth}{Distance (in cells) a cell has the be away from the patch
edge to be considered as core cell}
}
\value{
tibble
}
\description{
Mean number of disjunct core areas (Core area metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{DCORE_{MN} = mean(NCORE[patch_{ij}])}
where \eqn{NCORE[patch_{ij}]} is the number of core areas.

DCORE_MN is an 'Core area metric'. It summarises the landscape as the mean of all
patches in the landscape. A cell is defined as core if the cell has no neighbour with
a different value than itself (rook's case). NCORE counts the disjunct core areas,
whereby a core area is a 'patch within the patch' containing only core cells.

\subsection{Units}{None}
\subsection{Range}{DCORE_MN > 0}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Equals DCORE_MN = 0 if NCORE = 0 for all patches. Increases,
without limit, as the number of disjunct core areas increases.}
