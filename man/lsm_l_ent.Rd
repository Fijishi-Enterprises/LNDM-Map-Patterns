\title{ENT (landscape level)}
\usage{
lsm_l_ent(landscape, neighbourhood = 4, base = "log2")
}
\arguments{
\item{landscape}{Raster* Layer, Stack, Brick, SpatRaster (terra), stars, or a list of rasterLayers.}

\item{neighbourhood}{The number of directions in which cell adjacencies are considered as neighbours:
4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case). The default is 4.}

\item{base}{The unit in which entropy is measured.
The default is "log2", which compute entropy in "bits".
"log" and "log10" can be also used.}

\value{

\description{
Marginal entropy \[H(x)\]
}
\details{
It measures a diversity (thematic complexity) of landscape classes.
