\description{
Shannons's evenness index (Diversity metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{SHEI = \frac{- \sum \limits_{i = 1} ^ {m} (P_{i} * \ln P_{i})} {\ln m}}
where \eqn{P_{i}} is the proportion of class i and \eqn{m} is the
number of classes.

SHEI is a 'Diversity metric'. It is the ratio between the actual Shannon's diversity index
and and the theoretical maximum of the Shannon diversity index. It can be understood as a
measure of dominance.

\subsection{Units}{None}
\subsection{Range}{0 <= SHEI < 1}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Equals SHEI = 0 when only one patch  present and equals SHEI = 1
when the proportion of classes is completely equally distributed}
