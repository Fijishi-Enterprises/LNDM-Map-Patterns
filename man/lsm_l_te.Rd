\description{
Total edge (Area and Edge metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{TE = \sum \limits_{k = 1}^{m} e_{ik}}
where \eqn{e_{ik}} is the edge lengths in meters.
TE is an 'Area and edge metric'. Total edge includes all edges. It measures the
configuration of the landscape because a highly fragmented landscape will have many
edges. However, total edge is an absolute measure, making comparisons among landscapes
with different total areas difficult. If \code{cound_boundary = TRUE} also edges to the
landscape boundary are included.

\subsection{Units}{Meters}
\subsection{Range}{TE >= 0}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Equals TE = 0 if all cells are edge cells. Increases, without limit,
as landscape becomes more fragmented}
