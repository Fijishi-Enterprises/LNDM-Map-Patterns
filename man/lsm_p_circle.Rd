\description{
Related Circumscribing Circle (Shape metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{CIRCLE = 1 - (\frac{a_{ij}} {a_{ij}^{circle}})}
where \eqn{a_{ij}} is the area in square meters and \eqn{a_{ij}^{circle}} the area of
the smallest circumscribing circle.

CIRCLE is a 'Shape metric'. The metric is the ratio between the patch area and the smallest
circumscribing circle of the patch. The diameter of the smallest circumscribing circle is
the 'diameter' of the patch connecting the opposing corner points of the two cells
that are the furthest away from each other. The metric characterises the compactness
of the patch and is comparable among patches with different area.

\subsection{Units}{None}
\subsection{Range}{0 <= CIRCLE < 1}
\subsection{Behaviour}{CIRCLE = 0 for a circular patch and approaches CIRCLE = 1 for
a linear patch.}
