\usage{
lsm_p_core(
  landscape,
  directions = 8,
  consider_boundary = FALSE,
  edge_depth = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{landscape}{Raster* Layer, Stack, Brick, SpatRaster (terra), stars, or a list of rasterLayers.}

\item{directions}{The number of directions in which patches should be
connected: 4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case).}

\item{consider_boundary}{Logical if cells that only neighbour the landscape
boundary should be considered as core}

\item{edge_depth}{Distance (in cells) a cell has the be away from the patch
edge to be considered as core cell}
}

\description{
Core area (Core area metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{CORE = a_{ij}^{core}}
where \eqn{a_{ij}^{core}} is the core area in square meters

CORE is a 'Core area metric' and equals the area within a patch that is not
on the edge of it. A cell is defined as core area if the cell has no
neighbour with a different value than itself (rook's case). It describes patch area
and shape simultaneously (more core area when the patch is large and the shape is
rather compact, i.e. a square).

\subsection{Units}{Hectares}
\subsection{Range}{CORE >= 0}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Increases, without limit, as the patch area increases
and the patch shape simplifies (more core area). CORE = 0 when every cell in
the patch is an edge.}
