\title{GYRATE (patch level)}
\usage{
lsm_p_gyrate(landscape, directions = 8, cell_center = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{landscape}{Raster* Layer, Stack, Brick, SpatRaster (terra), stars, or a list of rasterLayers.}

\item{directions}{The number of directions in which patches should be
connected: 4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case).}

\item{cell_center}{If true, the coordinates of the centroid are forced to be
a cell center within the patch.}
}
\value{

\description{
Radius of Gyration (Area and edge metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{GYRATE = \sum \limits_{r = 1}^{z} \frac{h_{ijr}} {z}}
where \eqn{h_{ijr}} is the distance from each cell to the centroid of the
patch and \eqn{z} is the number of cells.

GYRATE is an 'Area and edge metric'. The distance from each cell to the
patch centroid is based on cell center to centroid distances. The metric
characterises both the patch area and compactness.

If \code{cell_center = TRUE} some patches might have several possible cell-center
centroids. In this case, the gyrate index is based on the mean distance of all
cells to all possible cell-center centroids.

\subsection{Units}{Meters}
\subsection{Range}{GYRATE >= 0}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Approaches GYRATE = 0 if patch is a single cell.
Increases, without limit, when only one patch is present.}
