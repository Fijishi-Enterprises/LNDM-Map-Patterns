\title{PARA (patch level)}
\usage{
lsm_p_para(landscape, directions = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{landscape}{Raster* Layer, Stack, Brick, stack, or a list of rasterLayers.}

\item{directions}{The number of directions in which patches should be
connected: 4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case).}
}
\value{
tibble
}
\description{
Perimeter-Area ratio (Shape metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{PARA = \frac{p_{ij}} {a_{ij}}}
where \eqn{p_{ij}} is the perimeter in meters and \eqn{a_{ij}} is the
area in square meters.

PARA is a 'Shape metric'. It describes the patch complexity in a
straightforward way. However, because it is not standarised to a certain
shape (e.g. a square), it is not scale independent, meaning that increasing
the patch size while not changing the patch form will change the ratio.

\subsection{Units}{None}
\subsection{Range}{PARA > 0}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Increases, without limit, as the shape complexity
increases.}
