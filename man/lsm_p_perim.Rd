\title{PERIM (patch level)}
\usage{
lsm_p_perim(landscape, directions = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{landscape}{Raster* Layer, Stack, Brick, SpatRaster (terra), stars, or a list of rasterLayers.}

\item{directions}{The number of directions in which patches should be
connected: 4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case).}
}
\value{
tibble
}
\description{
Perimeter (Area and edge metric))
}
\details{
\deqn{PERIM = p_{ij}}
where \eqn{p_{ij}} is the perimeter in meters.

PERIM is an 'Area and edge metric'. It equals the perimeter of the patch
including also the edge to the landscape boundary. The metric describes
patch area (larger perimeter for larger patches), but also patch shape
(large perimeter for irregular shapes).

\subsection{Units}{Meters}
\subsection{Range}{PERIM > 0}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Increases, without limit, as patch size and
complexity increases.}
