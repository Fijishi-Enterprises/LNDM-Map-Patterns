\arguments{
\item{landscape}{*Raster object}

\item{what}{Patch level what to plot}

\item{class}{How to show the labeled patches: "global" (single map), "all" (every class as facet),
or a vector with the specific classes one wants to show (every selected class as facet).}

\item{directions}{The number of directions in which patches should be
connected: 4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case).}

\item{consider_boundary}{Logical if cells that only neighbour the landscape boundary should be considered as core}

\item{edge_depth}{Distance (in cells) a cell has the be away from the patch edge to be considered as core cell}

\item{labels}{Logical flag indicating whether to print or not to print patch labels.}

\item{label_lsm}{If true, the value of the landscape metric is used as label}

\item{nrow, ncol}{Number of rows and columns for the facet.}

\value{

}
\description{
Show landscape metrics on patch level printed in their corresponding patch.
}
\details{
The function plots all patches with a fill corresponding to the value of the chosen landscape metric on patch level.
