\arguments{
\item{landscape}{Raster* Layer, Stack, Brick, SpatRaster (terra), stars, or a list of rasterLayers.}

\item{window}{Moving window matrix.}

\item{level}{Level of metrics. Either 'patch', 'class' or 'landscape' (or vector with combination).}

\item{metric}{Abbreviation of metrics (e.g. 'area').}

\item{name}{Full name of metrics (e.g. 'core area')}

\item{type}{Type according to FRAGSTATS grouping (e.g. 'aggregation metrics').}

\item{what}{Selected level of metrics: either "patch", "class" or "landscape".
It is also possible to specify functions as a vector of strings, e.g. \code{what = c("lsm_c_ca", "lsm_l_ta")}.}

\item{progress}{Print progress report.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed on to \code{calculate_lsm()}.}

\description{
Moving window
}
\details{
The function calculates for each focal cell the selected landscape metrics (currently only landscape level
metrics are allowed) for a local neighbourhood. The neighbourhood can be specified using a matrix. For more
details, see \code{?raster::focal()}. The result will be a \code{RasterLayer} in which each focal cell includes
the value of its neighbourhood and thereby allows to show gradients and variability in the landscape (Hagen-Zanker 2016).
To be type stable, the acutally result is always a nested list (first level for \code{RasterStack} layers, second level
for selected landscape metrics).
