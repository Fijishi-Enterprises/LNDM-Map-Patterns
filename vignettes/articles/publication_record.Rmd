We try to maintain a list of publications that have used the `landscapemetrics` package.
If you have used `landscapemetrics` in your own work, we would love to hear from you.
Please [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/marcosci/landscapemetrics/issues/new/) so we can add your work to this list.
