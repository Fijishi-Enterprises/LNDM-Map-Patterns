```

## Plot metrics

come up with ggplot wrapper for metrics to show metrics and compare landscapes

## Visualizing patches

To visualize patches in a landscape and encode each patch with an ID that can be used to compare a landscape metric with the actual landscape you can use the auxiliary visualisation function `show_patches()`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# show patch IDS
landscape_plot  + show_patches(landscape) + plot_layout(ncol = 1)
```

### Dissecting a landscape

If you are interested in each class and want to get an impression of the spatial distribution of this class, 
the [**landscapetools**](https://github.com/ropensci/landscapetools) package offers a function to plot 
lists, stacks and bricks of rasters as facets:

```{r fig.retina=2}
# show patch IDS
landscapetools::util
```



## Connected labelling 

`landscapemetrics` makes internally heavy use of an implementatian of the connected labelling algorithm by Thell Fowler (https://github.com/Thell/ccloutline) and exports an reimplementation of this algorithm:

```{r eval=FALSE}
cclabel_landscape <- landscapemetrics::cclabel(landscape)
util_facetplot(cclabel_landscape, nrow = 1)
```
